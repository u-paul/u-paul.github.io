- Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, IBM Cloud, Kubernetes, Docker, Hadoop, Spark

### Research experience

- 2018-*: Ph.D. Computer Science, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA
    - Designed and developed a new “broadband offering tool” and statistical frameworks to scalably
    collect and analyze price points of broadband offerings by major internet service providers in the U.S. The tool has been utilized to collect over **10** Million data points that enables enhanced insights into the problem
    of digital divide in the U.S. Currently focused on utilizing this tool and methodology to characterize the
    presence and extent of digital inequity between various geographical locations and demographics
    within the US. [*in progress*]
    - Developed a novel machine learning based Broadband Subscription Tier (BST) methodology, to idenitify the subscription tier a  given speed test taken by a user originates from. The methodology significantly enhances our understanding of crowdsourced measurements which further enables effective and accurate utilization of large scale crowdsourced datasets from [Ookla](https://www.speedtest.net/){:target="_blank"} and [Measurement-Lab](https://speed.measurementlab.net/#/){:target="_blank"}. [*To appear in IMC 2022*]
    - Curated a data set of 17,000 tweets obtained from the social media platform, Twitter, and developed a natural language processing framework to detect and isolate power and communication outage related tweets to assist first responders in the event of natural disasters. Implemented 22 different machine learning algorithms and achieved close to 90% accuracy in performing the required classification task. [*Published in WWW 2020*]
- 2022: PhD Research Intern, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY
    - Contributed to an Agent-Based Model (ABM) that simulates the impact of lack of good quality
    internet connectivity on populations of different socioeconomic status. Built the component of
    the model that estimates the effect of poor quality internet for different households. Additionally,
    contributed to the building of a web application that was deployed in IBM Cloud.
    - Conducted a longitudinal analysis on a dataset of **30** Million to understand how the internet quality has
    changed for different population groups. Applied statistical tests to determine the magnitude of
    difference in interent quality between sub-populations. Finally, deployed machine learning models
    to predict internet performance from demographics and infrastructure metrics. Work under review
    for publication.
