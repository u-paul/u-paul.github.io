### Personal summary

> PhD candidate of Computer science at UCSB working in the areas of internet measurement to understand and mitigate internet inequity. Passionate researcher with experience in conducting work across multidisciplinary fields of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Economics and Social Science. Major objective behind research is to identify and understand factors that contribute to internet disparity amongst communities and develop solutions that would enable stakeholders in mitigating the
persistent digital gap.

### Education
- Ph.D. Department of Computer Science, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara CA
- M.S. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa


### Technical

- Python, Matlab, Django, Flask, Node.js, Java, C, C++, Perl, Shell
- Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, IBM Cloud, Kubernetes, Docker, Hadoop, Spark

### Research experience

- 2018-*: Ph.D., University of California Santa Barbara
    - Designed and developed a new “broadband offering tool” and statistical frameworks to scalably
    collect and analyze price points of broadband offerings by major internet service providers in the U.S. The tool has been utilized to collect over **10** Million data points that enables enhanced insights into the problem
    of digital divide in the U.S. Currently focused on utilizing this tool and methodology to characterize the
    presence and extent of digital inequity between various geographical locations and demographics
    within the US. [*in progress*]
    - Developed a novel machine learning based Broadband Subscription Tier (BST) methodology, to idenitify the subscription tier a  given speed test taken by a user originates from. The methodology significantly enhances our understanding of crowdsourced measurements which further enables effective and accurate utilization of large scale crowdsourced datasets from [Ookla](https://www.speedtest.net/){:target="_blank"} and [Measurement-Lab](https://speed.measurementlab.net/#/){:target="_blank"}. [*To appear in IMC 2022*]
    - Curated a data set of 17,000 tweets obtained from the social media platform, Twitter, and developed a natural language processing framework to detect and isolate power and communication outage related tweets to assist first responders in the event of natural disasters. Implemented 22 different machine learning algorithms and achieved close to 90% accuracy in performing the required classification task. [*Publish in WWW 2020*]
