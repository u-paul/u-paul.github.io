<p align="justify">I am a PhD Candidate in <a href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computer Science</a>
  at the <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of California Santa Barbara</a>
  advised by <a href="https://ebelding.cs.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Belding</a> 
  and <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~arpitgupta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arpit Gupta</a>. I am a passionate researcher with extensive
  experience in conducting work across multidisciplinary fields of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Economics and Social Science.
  My research interests include communication networks, internet measurements, networking in challenged environment and natural language processing for information extraction. 
  The aim of my research is to understand the presence and extent of digital inequity between communities and subsequently build tools and methodologies to mitigate the divide. 
  I have experience of working with very large datasets, machine learning applications/algorithms, big data analytics and cloud computing platforms (IBM Cloud, Google Cloud, AWS and Microsoft Azure). 
  Prior to starting my PhD journey, I completed a M.S. degree in <a href="http://www.ee.uct.ac.za/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrical Engineering</a> from
  <a href="https://www.uct.ac.za/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Cape Town.</a> </p>
